Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jay.patel2422/viz/superstore_17394791459680/Dashboard1?publish=yes

<p>As part of my data analytics training course, I have aggregated sales csv superstore  data file and produced a dashboard visualisation showing sales trends, profit ratio and sales across different categories. This dashboard has been produced using Tableau and contains an interactive heatmap, line graphs and stacked bar graphs. I have implemeneted a vaiety of colours to ensure it can be interpreted by both non- technical and technical people.</p>
